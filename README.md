# PogoVision

** Warning: These repos are works in progress, use at your own risk, no support provided. **  Someday soon I hope to release this 
to the Roku app/channel store and put up the server publicly, but today is not that day.

One thing I really liked about AppleTV was the [photo screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdfgHPdiMAM) that would slowly scroll photos from your iPhoto or iCloud
collection at differing speeds and z-indices.  
  
Since I ditched AppleTV, I've been trying to create a Roku app/screensaver that does the same thing, fed by some cloud-based 
photo library (currently Google Photos, but someday Flickr).
  
This app is the Sinatra back end to the [Roku app/screensaver](https://github.com/armandofox/PogoVision).
